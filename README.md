# numeric_symbolic_schemes

The repository contains Mathematica notebooks/routines/notes for solving numerical and symbolic problems (ODEs/PDEs, Finite Elements, Optimisation)

Mostly includes solved examples that I followed from Wolfram training sessions & workshop (by Mario Veruete).

Note: the PDFs maybe compressed and so the graphics might look blurry or jagged at the ends.
