# -numeric_symbolic_schemes-
mathematica notebooks/routines/notes for solving numerical and symbolic problems (ODEs/PDEs, Finite Elements, Optimisation)


Mostly include solved examples that I followed from Wolfram.

Note: the PDFs maybe compressed and therefore any graphics might look blurry or jagged at the ends.
